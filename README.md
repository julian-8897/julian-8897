# About Me  

I am a PhD student at the University of Surrey working on *Machine Learning for Dynamical Systems* in Astrophysics. My research focuses on developing neural methods as surrogate models for complex gravitational dynamics, particularly N-body simulations of galaxy mergers and dynamics of supermassive black hole binaries.

## Research Interests
- *Neural Differential Equations*
- *Graph Neural Networks*
- *Operator learning and structure-aware models*
- *Symbolic Regression*  
- *Pretraining, transfer and multi-task learning for models across simulation regimes*
