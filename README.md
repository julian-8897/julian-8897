## About Me  

I am a PhD student at the University of Surrey working on advancing *Scientific Machine Learning* methods for Astrophysics. My research focuses on bridging machine learning with complex dynamical systems, particularly **N-body gravitational simulations** and galaxy merger dynamics.  

### Research Interests
- Graph Representation Learning  
- Pretraining and Transfer Learning for efficient model adaptation
- Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)  
- Symbolic Regression  
- Dynamics of Supermassive Binary Black Holes
- N-body Simulations

### Additional Interests
- Semantic search and information retrieval using pre-trained embedding models
- Fine-tuning open source LLMs for domain-specific applications

### Languages & Frameworks
