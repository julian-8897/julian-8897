## About Me  

I am a PhD student at the University of Surrey working on **Machine Learning for Dynamical Systems** in Astrophysics. My research focuses on developing neural methods as surrogate models for complex gravitational dynamics, particularly N-body simulations of galaxy mergers and dynamics of supermassive black hole binaries.

### Research Interests
- Neural Differential Equations
- Graph Neural Networks
- Operator learning and structure-aware models
- Symbolic Regression  
- Pretraining, transfer and multi-task learning for models across simulation regimes
