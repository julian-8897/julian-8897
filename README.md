I am a PhD student at the University of Surrey focused on advancing Scientific Machine Learning methods for Astrophysics, with a particular emphasis on bridging machine learning with complex dynamical systems such as N-body gravitational simulations.

**My primary interests are:**
- 🌌 Neural ODEs
- 🕸️ Graph Representation Learning
- 🧮 Symbolic Regression
- 🔄 Flow Matching
- 🚀 Pretraining & Transfer Learning
