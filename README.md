- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @julian-8897
- ðŸ‘€ PhD student at the University of Surrey's astrophysics department. My astrophysical interests include: N-body simulations, Supermassive black holes and stochastic gravitational wave background. In tandem, I'm very much interested in SciML, and how it can be applied to astrophysics to build and interpret surrogate models from simulations. The current techniques that I'm particularly fond of are: Bayesian Deep Learning, Physics-informed Neural Networks, Neural ODEs and Variational inference.
- ðŸŒ± I also enjoy building useful projects involving language models using LangChain and tools from HuggingFace.
- The zen of python is also my favourite bible verse.
