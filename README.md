- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @julian-8897
- ðŸ‘€ I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Surrey. My current research project involves the use of N-body simulations of galaxy mergers and machine learning techniques to calculate the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background as a function of black hole mass and galactic properties.
- ðŸŒ± Some of my other interests (but not exhaustive) include: Bayesian deep learning, Neural ODEs, Physics-Informed Neural Networks and LLMs.
